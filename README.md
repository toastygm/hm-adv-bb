# HârnWorld Adventure: The Bastard Bailiff

This module provides the adventure "The Bastard Baliff", a mini-adventure for the
[HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy setting. However, this
adventure could be located in any fantasy setting or location with minimal adaptations.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic, with the exception of Actors.
Detailed descriptions of the actors has been provided in journal entries to facilitate
conversion to other game systems.

On Hârn, this adventure takes place in Charmic Manor, in northern Kaldor, but it can be
easily adapted to suit any campaign location.

Beginning at Charmic Manor, the trail of the reneged bailiff leads to the city of Tashal
and from there to the Genin Trail.
